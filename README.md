Business Intelligence: An EDA for new launch of movie studio

In this project I downloaded a movies dataset from IMDB through another site called grouplens which provides a multitude of movies and other zipped files to use. In my repository it contains the movie dataset .csv file. It also includes my pdf file presentation along with the jupyter notebook folder with the necesaary EDA .ipynb notebook module with the source codes in it. Furthermore, they each provide a detailed description of the strategies, methods, analysis, etc. that I incorporated and used to collect, gather, research, and analyze to provide Microsoft access to statistical models to make a decision on what types of films to create for their new movie studio launch

I used a few statistical methods answer three questions such as the scatterplot, line graph, and the linear regression charts. This definitely proivded a sense of understanding and the nature in which producing certain genres of movies can attract movie goers for the long run basis. Also, it provides a clear insight on the types of movies that are sensible to produce. In the Powerpoint presentation pdf file, it explains the problem statement, methodology, data collection, data analysis & exploratory data analysis (EDA), findings (that provides three questions for the EDA processes), and a conclusion that would gives Microsoft a thorough scope for making certain types of film.

I incorporated several python libraries for this project such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Data visualizations where utilized to illustrate three distinctively proven statistical algorithms to produce conclusive results in answering three questions in relation to Microsofts problem statement.

Lastly, this project shows an intuitive apprach to using the data science platform as an alternative to other means such as financial analysis, performance indicators, market information, etc. as a way to provide the organization a tool to apply to future endeavors to expand.
